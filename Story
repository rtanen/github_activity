Once upon a time there lived a wizard in a forest full of Redwood trees. 
The wizard took a walk every morning with his companion, a large crow. 
As the two were wandering the forest, suddenly the crow flew away in a hurry.
The wizard was not startled that the crow flew off, because he knew his fondness for soaring above the treetops,
but given that the wizard was in the middle of a story it was unusual for the crow not to listen.
Afterall, the wizard told great stories. Unsure of why the why had taken off so abruptly, but trusting that it must be for good reason,
the wizard took a sharp right and followed suit. He had to know what had called the crow's attention, and perhaps even ask for an apology.

The wizard walked slowly. His years were not kind to him. He found a path leading toward where the crow flew.
Soon, the wizard noticed a purple tone in the path and smelt the scent of roasted meat. Could this be what attracted the crow's attention?
He pressed onwards, the crow was nowhere to be found. 
A giant mushroom apeared, it was hidden a dense wall of trees. On top was the crow, who pecked at the mushroom. 
"Why have you flown away" asked the wizard, "I was in the middle of a story."
